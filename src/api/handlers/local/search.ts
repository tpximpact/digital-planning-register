                  "Eton Conservation Area Advisory Committee Advice from Eton Conservation Area Advisory Committee: 06.07.2023 Re: 9 Steele’s Road: 2023/2198/P Replacement of existing lower ground floor rear extension; installation of timber French doors at rear; alterations to lower ground floor side fenestration; installation of dormer on rear roof slope; replacement of all windows with timber sash windows to match existing; and associated exterior works. It is the side elevation in this proposal that presents concerns. The new large - very large - side window exposing the stairs is an uncomfortably destabilising presence at the base of this elevation. There is an ill-fitting awkwardness about it, especially as it just manages to squeeze, by a sliver, beneath a newly raised ‘existing' window. It is one of two large presences in this elevation, the other being the proposed extension. Clad in Corten Steel, this extension introduces a markedly forceful presence, which is in some danger of overpowering the main house. It reads, in the drawing, as a defiantly different, almost separate, entity - rather than being in the nature of an addition. However, it is not possible for anyone to give a fully informed and fair judgement when all there is to go on is this drawing (and that of the rear elevation) at this scale. Does Camden agree with this? We would welcome a response to this concern as we have noticed a certain increase in the incidence of drawings submitted with applications that do not provide adequate accounts of a design. We think that a more detailed presentation of the extension, including perhaps CGI’s, is needed, and should be supplied. The new large side window can surely be made more accommodating to its elevation - at present it disregards the scale and patterning of the side wall’s fenestration - and be reduced in size. And the extension requires a further, fuller presentation. Yours sincerely, Eton CAAC",

          "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\r\n\r\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\r\n\r\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",

              "Eton Conservation Area Advisory Committee Advice from Eton Conservation Area Advisory Committee: 06.07.2023 Re: 9 Steele’s Road: 2023/2198/P Replacement of existing lower ground floor rear extension; installation of timber French doors at rear; alterations to lower ground floor side fenestration; installation of dormer on rear roof slope; replacement of all windows with timber sash windows to match existing; and associated exterior works. It is the side elevation in this proposal that presents concerns. The new large - very large - side window exposing the stairs is an uncomfortably destabilising presence at the base of this elevation. There is an ill-fitting awkwardness about it, especially as it just manages to squeeze, by a sliver, beneath a newly raised ‘existing' window. It is one of two large presences in this elevation, the other being the proposed extension. Clad in Corten Steel, this extension introduces a markedly forceful presence, which is in some danger of overpowering the main house. It reads, in the drawing, as a defiantly different, almost separate, entity - rather than being in the nature of an addition. However, it is not possible for anyone to give a fully informed and fair judgement when all there is to go on is this drawing (and that of the rear elevation) at this scale. Does Camden agree with this? We would welcome a response to this concern as we have noticed a certain increase in the incidence of drawings submitted with applications that do not provide adequate accounts of a design. We think that a more detailed presentation of the extension, including perhaps CGI’s, is needed, and should be supplied. The new large side window can surely be made more accommodating to its elevation - at present it disregards the scale and patterning of the side wall’s fenestration - and be reduced in size. And the extension requires a further, fuller presentation. Yours sincerely, Eton CAAC",
