# ODP Schema Types

This folder is copied as-is from the [digital-planning-data-schemas
](https://github.com/theopensystemslab/digital-planning-data-schemas) repo.

When they are published to NPM this folder will be deleted! We're 'faking' the npm import for now using tsconfig `@theopensystemslab/digital-planning-data-schemas`

Do not add anything to this folder - it is subject to be overwritten at any time!!


When it is in npm
- remove `@theopensystemslab/digital-planning-data-schemas` workaround
- remove `geojson` package and `@types/geojson` (Assuming we haven't used it elsewhere since this goes in)
